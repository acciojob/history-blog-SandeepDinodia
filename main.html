	<h3>Origin</h3>
	<p>In 1584 Rana Pratap again rebuffed emissaries of Akbar, who was preoccupied in the Punjab. Accordingly, Rana Pratap was able to recover most of his strongholds and died a hero to his people. He was succeeded by his son Amar Singh, who submitted in 1614 to Emperor Jahāngīr, son of Akbar.</p>
